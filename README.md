Coptic Calendar for Moodle
The Coptic calendar, also called the Alexandrian calendar, is used by the Coptic Orthodox Church and still used in Egypt. This calendar is based on the ancient Egyptian calendar. 

The calendar type system was introduced in 2.6, so this will not work in any Moodle versions earlier than this.
